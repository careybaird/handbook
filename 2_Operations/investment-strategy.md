# Investment Strategy

Niteo keeps reserves to [cover close to 12 months of average expenses](/5_People/profit-sharing.md). To not lose this money to inflation, we invest it into appreciating assets.


## Short-Term Pool

Reserves in safe and liquid assets. We try to keep the currency equally split between EUR and USD. Around 30% of total reserves.

Assets:
- cash on bank accounts (minimum 15% of total, default reserve)
- bonds (15% of total) with Vanguard BNDW (total world bonds in USD)


## Long-Term Pool

Reserves in more risky or illiquid assets. The currency split is not relevant because most of these assets compensate for the difference between EUR and USD. Around 70% of total reserves.

- real estate (20% of total) with [Niteo House](https://house.niteo.co) (EUR)
- stock ETFs (max 30% of total) with Vanguard VWRA (global stocks in USD)
- private funds (max 30% of total) with Calm Company Fund, Ben Tossel's No-Code Fund, etc.
- loans (max 10% of total)
- FOMO (max 5%) -> crypto stuff, individual stocks


## Summary

Keep in mind the above percentages are maximum for each asset class and are not supposed to be all maxed out (that's why the total comes out to 110%). For example: if we have maxed out real estate, stock ETFs and private funds, we're already over the recommended maximum for long-term pool.
